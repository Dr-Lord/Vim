   Description:
       This file contains a list of things to do and one to consider for most
       files in the project.

   Sections:
       0 - README.md
       1 - _vimrc
       2 - main_vimrc.vim
       3 - advanced_vimrc.vim
       4 - filetypes_vimrc.vim
       5 - extensions_vimrc.vim
       6 - familiar_mode_vimrc.vim
       7 - theme_vimrc.vim
       8 - updater.hs



"""" 0 - README.MD """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

CONSIDER:
    CALLING IT "PERFECT VIMRC"

    ADDING A LIST OF ALL MAPPINGS IN THE README

DO:
	Add a general version number in addition to single file ones

    List all the leader mappings

    Present it more: I tried not to change anything, just to add, exception Y. Reasons For it, structure, influences, method of creation. Thanks.


"""" 1 - _VIMRC """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

CONSIDER:
    If a second map on the same combination overwrites the first one, leave basic useful stuff in the normal vimrc, then tell people that source-ing the extension vimrc will overwrite those maps seamlessly. (Point in question: Bclose map to <leader>bc). (also write which map what overrites on both sides)

DO:
    Check Linux compatibility


"""" 2 - MAIN_VIMRC.VIM """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

CONSIDER:
	Adding buffer numbers at beginning of tab title, if possible

	CHANGING LEADER TO SPACE AND SEARCH TO SPACE SPACE

	MAPPING SPACE TO COMMAND (COLUMN) Or swap ; and : like Damian Conway

	Think about all mouse clicks

	Open a file from outisde Vim in a new Tab: http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=4214

DO:
   	Investigate the "smart way to move between windows" mappings; what do they do?

    Count search matches

    Focus on useful window splitting commands/maps

	Make double click also or triple click visually select a word (as well, in the case of double click)
    NOTE: This already happens in Insert mode

    Compare basic and familiar maps and functions for select-all

    Really think about swapfiles and backups: they are useful

    Make some mappings command-line mappings as well

    Take back some stuff from familiar_mode

    Better session management


"""" 3 - ADVANCED_VIMRC.VIM """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

CONSIDER:
    Automatic folding and look at all folding commands

DO:
    FIX BUG: SkipMatching quotes at BOL with chars after cursor present

    FIX BUG: Autocommenting ,k does not work on md and hs files (at least)

    Find a way to use Perl regexes instead of/in addition to/mixed with Vim's.
    Also look at magic and very magic.

    Find thesaurus and dictionary files and implement them


"""" 4 - FILETYPES_VIMRC.VIM """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

DO:
    Look at Damian Conway's for Perl


"""" 5 - EXTENSIONS_VIMRC.VIM """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

DO:
    Configure autocompletion extension more

    Whenever implementing addons, probably tell pathogen to use a folder in or around the repo in order to avoid admin permissions

    When implementing add-ons, do not delete obsolete maps, but deactivate them in the extensions vimrc


"""" 6 - FAMILIAR_MODE_VIMRC.VIM """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

DO:
    Really decide about using system clipboard always

    Make some familiar mappings work in visual mode as well


"""" 7 - THEME_VIMRC.VIM """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

CONSIDER:
    Multiple files for basically different themes


"""" 8 - UPDATER.HS """"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

CONSIDER:
	Making it actually update Vim itself

	Making it read and update the real _vimrc and gather and keep the "settings" (commented out stuff, folder names, ...)

	Make it update itself somehow:
		Run from another folder?
		Create a separate program which updates him?

	Making it work through:
		Zip files
		GitHub API
		Git modules

DO:
	First step: make it change the folder in the real _vimrc to the current folder

	Make it store only the name of the plugins, as the link is always the same slash the name NOTE: github account names are different

	Make it update both my repo and plugins

    First make it work, then make it safe (defensive, with eithers and stuff)?
